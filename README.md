# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a simple and fun Movie Recommender System I built using Python and Streamlit. Just select a movie from the dropdown, and itâ€™ll show you 5 similar movies along with their posters.

##  How it Works

- I used a pre-processed dataset of movies.
- The app loads a similarity matrix to find and suggest movies that are similar to the one you choose.
- Movie posters are fetched using TMDB API.
- The app is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**, so you can access it from anywhere!
